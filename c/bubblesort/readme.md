## THIS CODE IS *MOSTLY* DANGEROUS. CHECK IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Invoking arrays with variable length in C is not only stupid but also dangerous. It's better to have some extra memory allocated in an empty array, rather than having a random pointer fucking up everything and sending all in segmentation fault.

I'll leave all the dangerous programs with a *.warn.c* extension for later memory, the fixed ones won't have a flag.

### NON DANGEROUS FILES

For bubblesorting there will be two different interpretations:

1. The one my teacher gave us (weird and incomprensible [[to my stupid brain]])
2. MY own interpretation, which is obviously the best one as long as we're inside this github repo.

***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, THESE ARE JUST NOTES AND SMALL EXERCISES, NOT ACTUAL TESTED SHIT, I DON'T KNOW C THAT WELL*** *(yet)*

## update 17/01/2022. It doesn't fucking work for some reason, I hate bubblesort algorithms.
